<!--
* @JM_OneLess This is modified code from Card (Leo made that).
* I made Modifications as this card needed a drop down, and
* long story short, for formatting, making a new card was the
*  best way to go. This card is for Vaccine Eligibility Information
*  in Florida. I added in a drop down menu here.
